ðŸ§ª Experimental Trustless IPFS HTTP gateway providing access to UnixFS data via CAR CIDs.

How it works:

1. Extract `DATA_CID` from URL.
1. Lookup block index information in DyanmoDB
1. UnixFS export directly from S3 buckets using index data to locate block positions.

The search parameter `?origin` can optionally provide the hint of which CAR file(s) the data DAG is contained within. e.g.

```

```

## Getting Started

The repo contains the infra deployment code and the service implementation.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ packages   - autobahn core and lambda wrapper
â””â”€â”€ stacks     - sst and aws cdk code to deploy all the things
```

To work on this codebase **you need**:

- Node.js >= v18 (prod env is node v18)
- An AWS account with the AWS CLI configured locally
- Copy `.env.tpl` to `.env` and fill in the blanks
- Install the deps with `npm i`

Deploy dev services to your aws account and start dev console. You may need to provide a `--profile` to pick the aws profile to deploy with.

```console
npm start
```

See: https://docs.sst.dev for more info on how things get deployed.


## Environment variables

The following should be set in the env when deploying. Copy `.env.tpl` to `.env` to set in dev.

```sh
SENTRY_DSN=<your error reporting key here>

# Name of the "blocks-cars-position" table in DynamoDB
DYNAMO_TABLE=<table name here>

# Region of the DynamoDB to query
DYNAMO_REGION=us-west-2

# (optional) CSV of S3 regions of buckets that CAR files are stored in
S3_REGIONS=us-east-1,us-east-2,us-west-2
```
